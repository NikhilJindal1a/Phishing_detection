The Internet universal connectivity is both a boon and 
a breeding ground for phishing attacks, manipulating 
unsuspecting users into interacting with harmful links that 
redirect them to deceptive websites aiming to pilfer personal 
information. Phishing, a prevalent cyber threat, often uses cleverly 
disguised links in emails, texts, or social media that appear 
authentic, leading individuals to divulge sensitive details. 
Moreover, the unprecedented rise of artificial intelligence in 
recent years has also fueled a fresh wave of phishing attacks. These 
have become even more sophisticated, dangerous and prevalent. 
Therefore, there is a need to deploy advanced solutions that can 
automatically detect and prevent such phishing attacks. In this 
paper, the proposed solution analyzes URLs, considering factors 
like domain name, URL length, and the presence of suspicious 
keywords, seeking to differentiate between legitimate and phishing 
attempts. Further, various machine learning models are deployed 
to detect and classify phishing attacks to achieve an accuracy of 
95.2%.
